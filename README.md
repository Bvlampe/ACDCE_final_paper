This repository contains code and data for a research project into the relative importance of three internal characteristics of democratic systems to forecasting models on the future development and possible erosion of democracy as a whole. The merged dataset used as input for the models can be found under merged_data.csv, while model_data.csv contains the exact data (with forward-filled data specific to elections and missing data dropped) used in the main iteration of the models (5-year time lag, 1-point decreases in democracy-autocracy scores taken into consideration).
